# About
In this assignment, we create a burger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and ORM.

# Process
The user has a choice of burgers to eat. Once eaten, the burger will be moved to the devoured section and the user has the option to eat the hamburger again, or choose another. The user can also create their own burger to eat!
